# ble-sniffer
Python codes for Debian Linux (ie. Raspbian) to sniff and parse BLE (bluetooth low energy) packets from beacons and temperature/humidity-sensors.

bletempbeacon_pub.py is for reading Tokencube (http://tokencube.com/) sensors and Radius RadBeacons (https://store.radiusnetworks.com/products/radbeacon-dot).

blereader_ruuvi.py is for reading RuuviTag (https://ruuvi.com/) sensors.

Codes are parts of bigger projects and there might be minor bugs because of shrinking.
